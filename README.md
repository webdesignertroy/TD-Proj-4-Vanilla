# Vanilla JavaScript Interactive Photo Gallery
Project 4 Challenge (Revamp): Without using libraries, create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery from provided photos with descriptions.

At the top of the page, a search area will hide and show (filter) the photos below depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos.
