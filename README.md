# Vanilla JavaScript Interactive Photo Gallery
Project 4 Challenge (Revamp): Create an interactive photo gallery from a provided mockup, images and descriptions using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.(Do not rely on libraries.)

At the top of the page, a search area will hide and show (filter) the photos below depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos.
